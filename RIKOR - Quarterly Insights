Rikor Quarterly Planning Cross-Departmental Analysis

I. Required Inputs:

Individual Departmental Quarterly Planning Documents: I will provide you with the full text content of multiple departmental quarterly planning documents. Each document will be structured similarly to the "Leadership-Copy Template Quarterly Planning-How to effectively plan for the upcoming Quarter-Wade Millward.docx" that was previously discussed, and will contain sections such as "Review the Past Quarter," "Quarterly Rock Creation," "Establish Your Action Plan," etc. Please indicate when you are ready to receive these documents, and I will provide them one by one, clearly labeling each department (e.g., "Here is the Sales Department's Q3 Plan").
Rikor's Overarching Annual Goals: Please provide Rikor's top 3-5 company-wide annual goals for the current fiscal year. This is critical for assessing strategic alignment across all departmental plans.
II. Suggested Inputs (Optional, but enhance analysis):

Previous Quarter's Company-Wide Review/Results: If available, provide a summary of the company's overall performance, successes, and challenges from the prior quarter.
Organizational Chart (Text Summary): A brief description of Rikor's key departments and reporting lines, if relevant to understanding collaboration needs.
Key Strategic Imperatives/OKRs: Any additional specific, time-sensitive strategic focuses for the company that may not be full annual goals.
III. Analysis Process (Your Task):

As the strategic analyst, your task is to synthesize the provided departmental quarterly planning documents based on the Rikor Annual Goals. Your analysis should be highly focused and provide executive-level insights, avoiding excessive detail.

Data Extraction per Department: For each departmental plan provided, extract the following key information:

Their two primary "Quarterly Rocks" (the full SMART goal statement).
Their stated Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
Identified "Gaps in processes, resources, or strategies." 
Identified "Recurring challenges." 
Key stakeholders or departments identified for "Collaboration." 
Their "Present and Sell" narrative or "the why" for their goals. 
Assess Alignment with Annual Goals:

For each departmental "Rock," evaluate its direct contribution and alignment to the Rikor Overarching Annual Goals you are provided. Note strong alignments and any apparent disconnects.
Identify Cross-Departmental Synergies & Common Themes:

Look for common "Recurring Challenges" or "Gaps" cited across multiple departments, indicating potential systemic issues.
Identify opportunities for synergy where one department's "Rock" or initiatives could significantly benefit another, even if not explicitly stated in their plans.
Synthesize overarching themes from the departmental "Present and Sell" narratives.
Identify 2 Key Overlooked Strategic Initiatives (Most Important):

Based on your comprehensive analysis of all plans and considering Rikor's Overarching Annual Goals, identify two (2) distinct, high-impact strategic initiatives that appear critical for Rikor's overall success but have either:
Not been explicitly captured as a "Rock" by any single department.
Require significant cross-functional ownership and coordination that isn't clearly assigned or well-integrated across current plans.
For each overlooked initiative, provide a concise explanation of why it is critical for Rikor's overall success and suggest the type of cross-functional ownership it would likely require (e.g., "Marketing and Product," "IT and Operations").
IV. Desired Output Structure:

Present your findings in a concise and clear format, prioritizing high-level insights and impact.
