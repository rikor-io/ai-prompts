        "Bodily Injury Definition: [If limited, explain the critical importance of coverage for emotional/mental distress claims, even without physical injury, which are increasingly common in medical malpractice.]",

        "Specific Exclusions: [Detail any specific treatment, procedure, off-label use, or class action exclusions that our benchmark aims to avoid, and their potential impact.]",

        "Our benchmark policy is specifically crafted to address the comprehensive needs of men's health clinics, minimizing gaps and maximizing protection where it matters most. It ensures that critical aspects like your offsite medical directors, all healthcare providers, the specific treatments you offer, and a broad scope of potential 'bodily injury' claims (including those related to emotional or psychological distress) are robustly covered, often with defense costs that don't erode your primary indemnity limits. This proactive approach helps mitigate risks unique to your specialty and provides superior peace of mind.",
        "We recommend reviewing these areas to ensure your practice has the most comprehensive and tailored protection available. We are ready to help you further analyze your current policy against these standards and discuss how to achieve optimal coverage."
