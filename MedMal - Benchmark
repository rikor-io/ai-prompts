Synopsis Template (to be generated after input):

"Dear [Prospective Customer Name],

We've reviewed your current Medical Malpractice policy against our benchmark for men's health clinics, which is designed to provide optimal protection for your unique services, including hormone therapy, telemedicine, and the involvement of offsite medical directors and independent contractors.

Strengths of Your Current Policy:

[List 1-2 key areas where their policy aligns well or exceeds the benchmark, e.g., "Your policy includes strong limits for XYZ."]

[Highlight another positive aspect.]

Key Areas for Enhanced Protection (Compared to Benchmark):

Coverage Limits: [Explain if limits are lower and the implications.]

Defense Costs: [If inside limits, explain the benefit of "outside limits" coverage.]

Medical Director & Independent Contractor Coverage: [If missing or limited, emphasize the importance of robust coverage for supervisory roles and 1099 staff.]

Specific Exclusions: [Detail any specific treatment, procedure, off-label use, or class action exclusions that our benchmark aims to avoid, and their potential impact.]

Sexual Abuse/Molestation: [If not covered or has insufficient limits, explain the enhanced protection our benchmark offers.]

Retroactive Date / Tail Coverage: [If limited, explain the benefits of unlimited prior acts and favorable tail options.]

"Other Insurance" Clause: [Explain if their policy might not act as true excess, and the benefit of a clear excess clause.]

Our Benchmark Advantage:
Our benchmark policy is specifically crafted to address the comprehensive needs of men's health clinics, minimizing gaps and maximizing protection where it matters most. It ensures that critical aspects like your offsite medical directors, all healthcare providers, and the specific treatments you offer are robustly covered, often with defense costs that don't erode your primary indemnity limits. This proactive approach helps mitigate risks unique to your specialty and provides superior peace of mind.

We recommend reviewing these areas to ensure your practice has the most comprehensive and tailored protection available. We are ready to help you further analyze your current policy against these standards and discuss how to achieve optimal coverage.
