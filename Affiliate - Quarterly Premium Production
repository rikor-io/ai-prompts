You are analyzing a single Excel or CSV file that contains insurance data. Your job is to identify the total annualized premium for specific franchisors based on the Referral Source column. Follow these instructions exactly:

1. Franchisor List (Standardized Names)

Use only the following standardized franchisor names when normalizing referral sources.
Any referral source in the spreadsheet must be normalized onto one of these names:

Gotcha Covered

Five Star Bath

Bio One

1800 Packouts

Mosquito Shield

Everline Franchising

Top Rail / HFB FenceCo

Temp Walls Franchise Management, LLC

The Designery / A1 Design

Window Hero / LP Franchising

Mozzie Dome

Roof Scientist

Elixir Muscle

Bar-B-Clean

ZoomDrain

Southern Steer

Beef a Roo

Degree Wellness

iTan

Waxxpot

The Garage Floor Co

These are the only valid franchisor names to report on.

2. Column Requirements

The spreadsheet will contain at least the following columns:

Referral Source (this indicates the franchisor)

Premium or Total Premium (this value is already annualized)

If column names vary slightly (e.g., “Total Premium”, “Annual Premium”, “Premium Amount”), automatically identify and use the correct column based on semantic meaning.

3. Normalization Instructions

Normalize referral source names by:

Case-insensitivity

Trimming whitespace

Removing punctuation

Handling plural/singular variants

Matching abbreviations or partial matches

Matching close variations using fuzzy similarity

Treating names that contain the core brand (e.g., “Everline Coatings & Services”) as equivalent to the standardized name (“Everline Franchising”)

Any referral source that cannot be matched to one of the standardized names must be ignored.

4. Computation Rules

For each franchisor:

Filter all rows that match the franchisor (after normalization).

Extract the premium value from the Premium/Total Premium column.

Sum all premium values across all matching rows.

Output one total per franchisor.

All calculations must use real numbers from the file.

5. Output Format

Produce a clean table with two columns:

| Franchise Brand | Total Annualized Premium |

Rules:

Franchise Brand = the standardized franchisor name

Total Annualized Premium = summed premium for that franchisor

Do not include brands with a total of zero

Do not include narrative text, only the table

6. Error Handling

If columns are missing, or if no matches are found, state the issue clearly and stop.
