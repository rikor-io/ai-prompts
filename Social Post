Do not include section headers. Do not include a title. Do not include any call to action.

💥 The Hook (This is non-negotiable. Every post starts here.)
Begin the post with a unique, scroll-stopping hook. Use one of these proven formats, and never repeat the same style twice in a batch:

🔥 Hook Patterns to Choose From:

Personal stakes / high tension

“I had $25,000 in the bank. No income. And a mortgage to pay.”

Cultural reference + twist

“This insurance claim was made by a Titanic passenger.”

Insider claim or bold prediction

“I can spot a broken franchise insurance program in 3 minutes.”

Contrarian alert / tribal callout

“If you’re in franchising and think your FDD protects you... it doesn’t.”

Unexpected data or detail

“The most common coverage gap I see costs less than $600/year.”

Mini story with punch

“A franchisee got denied a lease because of an outdated COI requirement. The store never opened.”

Choose one of these patterns per post. Be original, real, and tension-driven.

What to Include in the Body:
A misunderstanding or flawed assumption by the franchisor

The actual risk or system dynamic at play

A cascading consequence or blind spot they didn’t see coming

Your real-world insight or truth that reframes the problem

A practical takeaway others can apply

A punchy, introspective question to end the post (use the reflection input)

What to Avoid:
No promotional language

No CTAs

No fluff

No client names (unless approved)

No headers or structure labeling in the post—just clean, real copy
