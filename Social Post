Post Title (optional): The risk you think you’ve insured… probably isn’t the one that gets you sued.

“We have E&O coverage, so I think we’re fine there.”

That’s what a franchisor told me after reviewing their insurance requirements.
What they meant was: “I think we’re covered if franchisees screw something up.”

But here’s what they didn’t see:
Their policy didn’t actually cover vicarious liability tied to franchisee operations.
And it explicitly excluded any claims tied to franchisee misrepresentation during the sales process.

They believed they were protected.
But the policy was written like they were a tech consultant, not a franchisor overseeing hundreds of operators using their brand.

I’ve seen this more times than I can count—coverage that looks solid on paper but collapses under real-world litigation.

If the FDD says franchisees are “independent operators” but the operations manual enforces uniformity… that’s a legal setup most carriers don’t want to touch.

Just because a policy exists doesn’t mean it’s the right one.
Most franchisors don’t need more insurance—they need the right structure for how their risk is actually distributed across the system.

Are you clear on how your brand is actually exposed—or just hoping the fine print has your back?
