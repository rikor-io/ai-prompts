Convert the following blog post into a high-performance LinkedIn post, maximum 2,500 characters.

Your job is to transform the long-form blog into a bold, insight-driven, founder-style post that performs well on LinkedIn.

Follow these rules:

1. Start with a unique, scroll-stopping hook:
   - a bold claim,
   - a controversial statement,
   - a surprising truth,
   - or a real franchisor quote or scenario (anonymized).

2. Break everything into short, single-thought paragraphs that are easy to read on mobile.

3. Use the authentic founder voice:
   - direct,
   - opinionated,
   - experience-based,
   - story-infused,
   - no corporate jargon.

4. Highlight:
   - a common misconception,
   - the overlooked risk or blind spot,
   - the hard truth,
   - and the practical takeaway for franchisors or small business owners.

5. Include meaningful detail from real conversations, but keep it anonymized.

6. Avoid:
   - promotional language,
   - calls to action,
   - hashtags,
   - emojis,
   - sales pitches,
   - phrases like "here's the truth",
   - or anything that feels like marketing.

7. Make the insights punchy and useful:
   - something a franchisor reads and says, “I needed this.”

8. End with a reflective, punchy line that lands the insight. No questions.
