**Objective:**
Analyze the provided Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) to calculate the **Strategic Priority Score ()**. This model identifies systemic vulnerabilities and generates a tailored **Optimization Roadmap** to reduce churn, prevent litigation, and achieve royalty self-sufficiency.

---

# Phase 1: Forensic Extraction

Extract the following data points from the FDD (Items 1-21). If data is missing, estimate conservatively.

1. 
**System Age**: Years since franchising began.


2. 
**Litigation Count**: Total franchisee-initiated or material lawsuits in the last 3 years.


3. 
**Transparency Level**: Depth of Item 19 financial performance disclosure.


4. 
**Net Worth Requirement**: Estimated liquid/net worth requirements for candidates.


5. **Solvency/Runway**:
* 
*Emerging*: Cash on Hand vs. Net Income (excluding one-time fees) burn rate.




6. 
**Churn Rate**: (Terminations + Non-Renewals + Reacquired + Ceased) / Total Operating Units.


7. **SNO Velocity (Sold Not Open)**:
* 
*Emerging*: % of SNO units signed >12 months ago ("Stalled Units").




8. 
**Support Bandwidth**: Ratio of Field Support Staff to Total Committed Units (Open + SNO) .

# Phase 2: Variable Scoring Assignment

Assign values based on the extracted data. **Apply "Emerging" logic for Big Chicken (<100 units AND <10 years franchising).** 

### A.  (Reputation & Backing) [1-10]

* 
**10**: >10 Years Franchising OR Strong Institutional/PE Backing (Emerging).


* **7**: 5-10 Years Franchising.
* **3**: <5 Years Franchising.
* **1**: History of management bankruptcy or <1 year franchising.

### B.  (Factual Transparency) [1-10]

* **10**: Full P&L (Revenue + COGS + Labor + EBITDA).
* **7**: Adjusted Gross Profit (Revenue - COGS).
* **5**: Gross Sales Only.
* 
**1**: No Item 19 Disclosure (Critical Failure for Emerging Brands).



### C.  (Candidate Quality Proxy) [0.5 - 1.5]

* 
**1.5**: High Net Worth (>$1M) OR **Multi-Unit Operators dominate pipeline** (Emerging).


* **1.0**: Standard Net Worth ($250k - $1M).
* **0.5**: Low Barrier (<$100k) OR 100% First-Time Single-Unit Owners.

### D.  (Profitability & Liquidity - Emerging Logic) [1-10]

* **10**: Cash Runway > 18 Months (excluding new franchise sales).
* **5**: Cash Runway 6-12 Months.
* 
**1**: Cash Runway < 6 Months OR Solvency dependent on "Paper Assets".



### E.  (Governance Capital) [1-10]

* 
**10**: Formal FAC  + Mandatory Mediation.


* **1**: No FAC and litigation-first clauses.

### F.  (Operational Excellence) [1-10]

* 
**10**: Automated support + AI site selection.


* **1**: Manual reporting + low support ratios.

### G.  (Negative Weight) [0-10]

* **0**: Zero litigation.
* 
**5**: 3+ lawsuits or 1 material franchisee-initiated action.


* **10**: Class Action / Fraud.

### H.  (Multiplier) [Actual %]

* Calculation: (Terminations + Ceased) / Total Units.


* 
**Correction (Emerging)**: Add 0.15 if >25% of SNO units are "Stalled" (>12 months old).

# Phase 4: Deliverable Format

## I. Strategic Diagnostic

* **Calculated **: [X.X]
* **Current Phase**: [Overhaul / Refinement / Scaling]
* **Primary Friction Point**: [Identify the variable dragging the score down most].

## II. The Optimization Roadmap (Action Items)

1. **Transparency & Capital Attraction**: [Recommendation for Item 19].
2. **Pipeline Stabilization & Retention**: [Recommendations for Churn/SNO].
3. **Litigation Shielding & Partnership Culture**: [Recommendations for Governance].
4. **Financial Pivot**: [Path to Royalty Sustainability].

## III. Profile Match

* [ ] **The Valley of Death**: Emerging, low cash, fee-dependent.
* [ ] **The Friction Trap**: High litigation, high churn, poor governance.

## IV. The "Golden Lever"

[The single most impactful change to increase brand value.]

**Execution on Big Chicken FDD:**

### I. Strategic Diagnostic

* **Calculated **: **4.8**
* **Current Phase**: **Systemic Overhaul Required**
* **Primary Friction Point**: **Factual Transparency () and Systemic Leakage ()**.

### II. The Optimization Roadmap

1. 
**Transparency**: Big Chicken currently provides **No Item 19 Disclosure**. This results in a  score of 1. To move to an "Elite" tier, the brand must disclose unit-level EBITDA to prove the model to institutional developers.


2. 
**Pipeline Stabilization**: 2024 saw **9 franchised unit terminations** against only 22 open units—a 40.9% churn rate. The brand must audit its "Area Developer" vetting process, as multiple multi-unit agreements were signed and then terminated shortly after.


3. 
**Litigation Shielding**: The pending **DMD Chicken federal lawsuit**  and the 2024 termination spike signal a high-friction environment. Formalizing the **Franchisee Advisory Council (FAC)** (currently only a future intent)  is the primary lever to reduce this friction.


4. 
**Financial Pivot**: In 2024, **Franchise Fees ($1.77M)** exceeded **Royalty Revenue ($1.7M)**. To escape "The Valley of Death," the brand must leverage the Craveworthy Brands shared service model to reduce corporate G&A until royalties cover >80% of costs.



### III. Profile Match

* [X] **The Valley of Death**: The system is currently in a high-churn emerging phase where solvency is heavily reliant on new franchise fee collection rather than the underlying royalty stream from open units.



### IV. The "Golden Lever"

**Publishing Unit-Level Profitability in Item 19** will provide the transparency needed to attract the high-quality Area Developers the system requires to reach royalty self-sufficiency.
