PROMPT START

Convert the blog below into a high-performing email formatted for ActiveCampaign.

Return ONLY the final output in the exact format specified under OUTPUT FORMAT.
No commentary. No extra options. No explanations.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Write at a 5th–6th grade reading level.

No jargon.

No acronyms on first mention.

First mention format: Full Name (ACRONYM) — only if the acronym is used again later.

If you won’t use the acronym again, don’t include it.

Keep it tight, clear, and worth reading.

Avoid repetitive intros.

Critical clarity rule (since there is no Definitions section)

If you include any insurance/legal/technical term that most readers won’t understand, you must either:

Replace it with plain-English wording, OR

Add a very short plain-English explanation inline (in the same sentence).
Do NOT create a separate definitions section.

Critical opener rule

The first line after “Hi there,” must NOT include phrasing like:

“The hot issue is…”

“Today we’re talking about…”

“I wanted to share…”

“Here’s a quick insight…”

Instead, it must open directly with the core issue in plain English.

PERFORMANCE LOGIC (DO THIS FIRST)

From the blog, identify:

The single most concerning / attention-grabbing topic (the hot issue).

The biggest consequence if ignored (cost, lawsuit risk, brand damage, franchisee harm, growth drag).

The most surprising insight or misconception the blog corrects.

The subject, preheader, intro, and bullets must all center on that hot issue.

SUBJECT LINE RULES (Hook with consequence)

Create ONE subject line that:

Is 4–9 words

Uses plain English (no jargon, no acronyms)

Is rooted in the blog’s single hottest issue

Must imply a real consequence (cost, lawsuit risk, loss of control, coverage gap, franchisee blowback)

Must feel relevant immediately to a franchisor (brand/system protection)

Is not clickbait (no hype, no tricks)

Allowed subject styles (choose ONE that best fits the blog)

Consequence-led: implies what breaks or what it costs

Pattern: “When X happens, Y breaks”

Risk-led: implies exposure or being unprotected

Pattern: “You may not be covered for X”

Contrarian-led: challenges a common belief

Pattern: “The X idea backfires”

Subject quality checks (must pass all)

Do not use soft language like may, might, could unless absolutely necessary.

Do not make it so broad it could apply to any business.

Must create curiosity and signal stakes in the same line.

PREHEADER RULES (Teaser)

Write ONE preheader that:

Is 90–130 characters

Adds new information (not a repeat of the subject)

Creates curiosity and promises value

Uses plain English

No jargon, no acronyms

EMAIL BODY RULES (ActiveCampaign formatting)

Target 250–450 words

Short paragraphs (1–2 sentences)

Use real bullet points with “•”

Bold ONLY section labels (example: Top takeaways:)

Each bullet must be under 14 words

Bullets must be plain English (no technical terms)

Simple, skimmable, mobile-friendly

OUTPUT FORMAT (RETURN EXACTLY THIS)

Subject: [subject line]
Preheader: [preheader teaser]
