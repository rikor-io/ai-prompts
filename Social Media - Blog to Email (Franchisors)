PROMPT START

You are turning the following blog into a simple, skimmable, high-impact email for franchisors.

Your job is to extract the 5 biggest takeaways and rewrite them in ultra-simple layman’s terms, so a franchisor can read the email in seconds and understand exactly why it matters.

AUDIENCE

Franchisors, multi-brand operators, and founders who want to:

Protect their system

Reduce liability

Strengthen insurance requirements

Protect franchisee investments

Scale without surprises

They are extremely busy and skim everything.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1. No jargon — ever

Do not use any industry or legal terms that a normal person wouldn’t know.

2. No acronyms

If the blog mentions a coverage or policy that is typically an acronym, you must:

A) Spell out the full name
B) Immediately define it in the simplest terms possible

Definitions must be:

One sentence

Written at a 5th–6th grade reading level

Clear enough for someone with zero insurance background

Inline ( parentheses ), NOT separate

Example format:
Employment Practices Liability Insurance (coverage that protects a business from issues like discrimination, sexual harassment, or wrongful termination)

Definitions do not count toward the bullet word limit.

3. Define every coverage

This rule applies universally:

General Liability

Professional Liability

Directors and Officers

Cyber Insurance

Umbrella Insurance

ANY insurance coverage mentioned

Spell it out + define it simply.
Never assume the reader knows what it means.

EMAIL FORMAT
1. Subject Line (non-negotiable)

Must be:

2–6 words

Curiosity-based

Emotionally compelling

Aligned with the blog’s core problem or insight

Follow Neil Patel’s rules:

Short

Punchy

Creates tension or curiosity

Clearly relevant to franchisors

Examples to mimic (do NOT reuse directly):

“A Risk You Can’t Ignore”

“The Hidden Gap”

“Why Brands Get Burned”

“Before This Gets Expensive”

“Franchisors Miss This”

“What Causes Franchise Chaos”

“Your Most Overlooked Liability”

The subject should feel like a warning + insight hybrid.

2. Intro (2 sentences max)

Follow StoryBrand:

Sentence 1: Identify the ONE problem the blog helps franchisors solve.

Sentence 2: Tell them why it matters for protecting their brand or franchisees.

No jargon. No insurance-speak. No fluff.

3. Top 5 Takeaways

Produce five bullets, each:

Under 14 words (definitions don’t count)

One simple idea

Written in plain English

Framed around brand protection, franchisee protection, or system stability

Strong enough to work as standalone headlines

Format example:

Hidden risks multiply when every franchisee uses different coverage rules.
(General Liability insurance = coverage that protects a business when someone gets hurt or property is damaged.)

Include the definition immediately under the bullet only if necessary for clarity.

4. Closing CTA
