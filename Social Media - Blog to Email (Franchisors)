PROMPT START

You are converting the following blog into a simple, skimmable, high-impact email written specifically for franchisors.

Your job is to extract the five biggest insights and present them in ultra-simple layman’s terms, so a franchisor can absorb the message in seconds and understand exactly why it matters.

AUDIENCE

Franchisors, multi-brand operators, and founders who want to:

Protect their system

Reduce liability

Understand legal and insurance risk

Protect franchisee investments

Scale without unpleasant surprises

They skim their email.
Everything must be instantly clear.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES
1. No jargon

Everything must be written at a 5th–6th grade reading level.

2. No acronyms on first mention

If any insurance coverage or legal/technical term appears:

Write the full name the first time

After that, you MAY use the acronym

Only after defining it.

3. Smart Definition Rule

Use reasoning to determine which terms need definitions.

Define ANY term that:

A typical franchisor wouldn’t know

Is insurance-related

Is legal-related

Is tied to liability or claims

Is a technical or complex concept

Examples (ONLY if they appear in the blog):

Co-defendant

Joint employer

Vicarious liability

Indemnification

Duty to defend

Claims-made

Occurrence

Retroactive date

Any coverage type

Any contract or legal term that could create confusion

Definitions must:

Go ONLY at the bottom

Be one sentence

Use ultra-simple, everyday language

Appear once only

Not count toward bullet limits

CORE LOGIC: IDENTIFY THE MOST CONCERNING TOPIC

Before writing the email, you MUST analyze the blog and identify the:

single most concerning, highest-risk topic for franchisors.

This is the topic that:

Carries the greatest legal, financial, or operational consequences

Is emphasized in the blog

Represents a major warning, blind spot, or brand-level threat

This topic MUST drive:

The subject line

The intro

The framing of the bullet points

The overall urgency

Do NOT assume what the topic is —
determine it based on the blog.

EMAIL STRUCTURE
1. Subject Line (must highlight the blog’s most concerning topic)

Requirements:

2–6 words

Hook-based

Emotionally compelling

High stakes implied

Uses the blog’s biggest risk as the anchor

Neil Patel rule: short, punchy, curiosity-driven

No jargon

Formats to mimic (do not reuse exact lines):

“Your Hidden Risk”

“A Serious Warning”

“Before This Gets Expensive”

“The Blind Spot Here”

“Why This Hurts Brands”

But the subject must reflect the central risk identified in the blog.

2. Intro (2 sentences MAX)

Follow StoryBrand principles.

Sentence 1:
Name the ONE most concerning topic or risk the blog focuses on.

Sentence 2:
Explain why this risk matters directly to system protection or franchisee investments.

Keep it extremely simple.

3. Top 5 Takeaways (must be real bullet points)

Use bullet points like:

• or –

Rules:

EXACTLY five bullets

Under 14 words each (definitions don’t count)

One idea per bullet

Simple, high-level language

Every bullet should tie back to the central risk/topic

No definitions inside the bullets

Acronyms allowed only after the full name + definition appear in the definitions section

Bullets should feel like quick-hit warnings or insights

Format example (structure only):

Top 5 takeaways:
• [Short, simple risk insight tied to the main topic]
• [Short insight #2]
• [Short insight #3]
• [Short insight #4]
• [Short insight #5]

4. Definitions Section (BOTTOM of email)

Only define the terms that:

Appear in the email

A typical franchisor wouldn’t understand

Use this exact header:

Definitions (in simple terms):

Format:

Full term (no acronym): one-sentence, ultra-simple explanation

Examples of style (do NOT insert unless they appear in the blog/email):

Co-defendant: when two or more parties are sued together in the same lawsuit.

Joint employer: when two businesses can be treated as the shared employer of the same worker.

General Liability Insurance: coverage that protects a business if someone gets hurt or property is damaged.

Again, definitions appear once only.
