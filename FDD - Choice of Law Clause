✅ Updated Output Example (Utah):

Category	Details
Choice of Law State	Utah
Legal Standard	Four Corners Rule — courts compare only the complaint and policy. Extrinsic evidence is rarely considered.
Practical Effect of Standard	If the complaint doesn’t allege a covered claim (e.g., negligence), insurers can deny defense early. Limited leverage to force coverage through facts outside pleadings.
Exclusion Interpretation	“Arising out of” is interpreted broadly. Intentional or fraudulent allegations can bar defense. Mixed claims may still trigger defense but are often disputed.
Insurer Leverage	High — narrow pleading and broad exclusions increase the likelihood of early denial.
Risk Rating	Moderate – High
Strategic Mitigation	• Strengthen pleadings to ensure at least one negligence claim is alleged
• Narrow or clarify “arising out of” language during policy negotiations
• Include contract provisions that clarify defense obligations in mixed-claim scenarios
• Consider forum and governing law that provide better defense triggers (e.g., Texas), but prioritize contractual leverage over jurisdictional shopping
• Build pre-litigation strategies to pressure carriers early (e.g., tendering with clear coverage framing)
Bottom Line	Utah gives carriers strong early denial leverage. Franchisors can offset this through strategic pleading, contractual language, and selecting more defense-favorable forums when possible.

📌 Additional Guidance for State Recommendations
✅ Texas: Favorable — strict Eight Corners rule, narrow insurer ability to deny early.
⚠️ Utah: Neutral–Unfavorable — strict Four Corners rule but broad exclusion interpretation.
❌ Florida: Unfavorable — broad extrinsic evidence use favors carriers.
⚠️ California: Neutral — mixed; potential coverage standard but carriers can deny early using extrinsic evidence.

Key Principle:
Always focus on strengthening franchisor control through contract language, pleading strategy, and forum selection — not simply choosing states perceived as defense-friendly.
