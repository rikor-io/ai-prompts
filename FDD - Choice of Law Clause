    "step_1": "Identify the stateâ€™s duty-to-defend legal standard and how it affects insurer leverage.",
    "step_2": "Evaluate how broad exclusions (e.g., financial guarantee) are interpreted under that state.",
    "step_3": "Determine the impact on defense obligations when mixed claims (excluded and covered) are present.",
    "step_4": "Craft one or more plain-language scenarios that show what happens to the franchisor financially under this legal environment.",
    "step_5": "Recommend strategic mitigation (e.g., forum selection, choice of law adjustments, contractual language improvements).",
    "step_6": "Classify overall defense favorability and assign a risk rating."

        "description": "A franchisee sues the franchisor for fraudulent inducement, claiming the franchisor made false revenue promises. The insurer denies defense under a financial guarantee exclusion. Because the chosen state has a broad 'arising out of' interpretation, this single allegation is enough to bar coverage for the entire case â€” including service-related claims that might otherwise have been covered.",

        "description": "A franchisee lawsuit combines both revenue promise allegations (excluded) and service failure claims (potentially covered). The insurer denies defense, linking all claims back to the excluded subject matter. The state's interpretation gives the franchisor no path to force defense.",
        "outcome": "Early denial, high legal costs."
