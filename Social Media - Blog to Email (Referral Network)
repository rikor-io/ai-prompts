FINAL REFERRAL-SOURCE EMAIL PROMPT (Simple, Value-Driven, Thought Leadership)

PROMPT START

You are turning the following blog into a simple, conversational, high-value email written specifically for referral sources who work with franchisors.

Referral sources already know who we are and what we do.
Your goal is to keep us top of mind by sharing:

A simple insight

A simple lesson

A simple perspective

A simple example of how we’re helping franchisors protect their brand, their system, or their franchisees

ALL messaging must come from the blog.

The email must feel like a short, friendly “industry update,” not a sales pitch.

AUDIENCE

Referral partners such as:

Franchise consultants

Franchise attorneys

Supplier partners

Private equity groups

Franchise operations advisors

Anyone who works with franchisors regularly

They want:

To stay informed

To stay ahead of problems

To share useful insights with their brands

To have confidence in referring franchisors to us

To know we think deeply about franchisor risk and protection

They want value, not complexity.

GOALS

The email should accomplish three things:

1. Establish thought leadership

Show that we understand franchisor risk and brand protection at a deep level.

2. Provide value and relevance

Give the reader a quick insight they could apply or share with their brands.

3. Keep Rikor top of mind

Friendly, helpful, consistent.

This is NOT about pitching.
This is NOT about asking for referrals.
This is about staying relevant.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

No jargon

No acronyms unless spelled out the first time

Ultra-simple language

Never talk down to the reader

Never include definitions unless the blog requires it (keep this email simpler than the franchisor version)

Absolutely no sales language

No calls to action beyond the optional “If you want to read the full article…” link

Keep it human, warm, and conversational

EMAIL STRUCTURE
1. Subject Line

Must be:

Simple

Relevant

Lightly intriguing

Benefit or insight-driven

3–7 words

No jargon

No fear-based language

Examples of style (DO NOT reuse):

“A Quick Insight”

“What We’re Seeing Lately”

“A Trend Worth Watching”

“Something You’ll Appreciate”

“A Thought for You Today”

The subject line should reflect the central insight from the blog, but stay casual and friendly — like a colleague sharing something useful.

2. Greeting

Use one simple greeting:

Hi there,

(Do not change this.)

3. Short Intro (1–2 sentences ONLY)

Purpose:

Set context

Share that this is a new learning or observation

Keep it friendly and conversational

Example structure (not actual text):
“We’ve been seeing something interesting across the franchising space lately. This blog highlighted it perfectly, so I wanted to pass along a quick takeaway.”

4. Insight Summary (3–4 short bullets)

This replaces the franchisor version’s “Top 5 takeaways.”

Referral sources need shorter, broader, higher-level perspective.

Use exactly 3–4 bullet points.
Bullets must be:

Very short

Simple

High-level

Focused on helping franchisors succeed

Focused on brand protection or system improvement

Representative of the blog’s core insight

Examples of bullet style (not content):

How this issue shows up for franchisors

Why it matters

The impact on franchisee success or brand protection

A practical framing or observation from the blog

5. Soft Closing Line

Use one simple sentence:

“If you want to read the full article, you can find it here: [Insert Link]”

Simple. Neutral. No pitch.

6. No definitions section

Referral sources are industry-adjacent professionals — they don’t need simple definitions unless a term is so niche that even consultants or attorneys wouldn’t know it.

Use your best judgment based on what’s in the blog.

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the email like this:

Subject: [Simple, insightful subject line]

[1–2 sentence intro]

Here are a few quick takeaways from it:
• [Insight bullet #1]
• [Insight bullet #2]
