PROMPT START

You are turning the following blog into a high-value, insight-forward email written for referral partners who work with franchisors (consultants, attorneys, supplier partners, private equity groups, etc.).

Your goal is to create an email that:

Provides real value

Gives them something they can forward to their franchisor clients

Keeps us top of mind

Demonstrates thought leadership

Is simple, unique, and worth reading

Positions us as the team helping franchisors avoid real risks

Feels like an insider industry update, not a sales pitch

This email must be:

One-of-a-kind

Naturally written

Not repetitive

Not formulaic

Everything must be based on the blog.

AUDIENCE

Referral partners who understand franchising but appreciate:

Clear insights

Trends

Pitfalls

Tools to help their brands

Early warnings

Best practices

System-protection strategies

They want to look smart to their clients.
Give them something they can use.

WHAT THIS EMAIL MUST ACCOMPLISH

Deliver an insight they can share with franchisors.

Make them think of Rikor as a trusted expert.

Stay top of mind, without pitching.

Give them a simple takeaway they can pass along.

Show how we’re helping brands solve real problems.

NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES

Absolutely no jargon.

No acronyms unless spelled out the first time.

Ultra-simple, conversational language.

No corporate tone.

No “generic intros” — every intro must feel fresh and unique.

No sales pitch.

No requests for referrals (they know).

Must feel like “Here’s something interesting I thought you’d appreciate.”

EMAIL STRUCTURE
1. Subject Line (must be a hook)

You MUST craft a compelling subject line based on:

The most useful, surprising, or concerning insight from the blog

Something a referral partner would WANT to open

Clear curiosity

Clear relevance

Clear forwardability

Subject must be:

4–9 words

Benefit-oriented

Insight- or warning-based

Never generic

Examples of style (NOT samples to reuse):

“A Pattern We’re Seeing Across Brands”

“Franchisors Are Asking About This”

“A Risk Worth Flagging Early”

“This Catches Brands Off Guard”

“A Quick Insight You’ll Appreciate”

“What Franchisors Keep Missing”

Subject must reflect the biggest, most forwardable insight in the blog.

2. Intro Paragraph (unique each time)

This should be:

Conversational

Natural

Insightful

Human

NOT formulaic

1–2 sentences

It should:

Quickly set context (“Saw something interesting…” / “Been noticing a trend…” / “This came up again this week…”)

Connect the blog’s topic to challenges franchisors face

Make the reader feel like they’re getting insider intel

3. Insight Summary (3 simple bullets)

These bullets should be:

Easy to skim

High-level

Designed for referral partners to forward

Framed as: “Here’s something useful your franchisors should know”

Not technical

Not compliance-heavy

Totally based on the blog

Focused on franchisor/system protection

Examples of style (NOT content):

• What this issue means for a franchisor
• Why this matters during scaling
• How it shows up in the real world
• One key blind spot franchisors usually overlook

Exactly 3 bullets — nothing more.

4. “Shareable Takeaway” (1 sentence)

End the bullets with a standout takeaway they could copy/paste to a franchisor:

A simple, useful, practical “If your franchisors ask about this, here’s the one thing to tell them.”

Format:

“If this comes up with one of your franchisors, here’s the simplest way to explain it: [short takeaway].”

Short, clear, high-value.

5. Soft Closing Line

Friendly, not salesy:

“If you want to read the full breakdown, here’s the link: [Insert Link]”

NO DEFINITIONS SECTION HERE

Referral partners don’t need beginner-level definitions.
Only define a term inline if the blog requires it for clarity.
