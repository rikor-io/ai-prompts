Guidelines:
- Use robust synonyms: e.g., CGL/GL → commercial-general-liability; WC/EL → workers-compensation-employers-liability; Umbrella/Excess → commercial-excess-liability; Environmental/CPL → commercial-environmental-liability; BAP/Business Auto → commercial-auto-liability, etc.
- Prefer headings, tables, or bold labels as strong signals.
- Return multiple detections if the document contains multiple coverages.
- If unsure, return the top 2 candidates with best confidence and the signals.
