Convert the following blog post into a Medium-ready article.

Your job is to transform the structured, SEO-oriented blog into a narrative, story-driven Medium piece that feels personal, thoughtful, and human.

Follow these rules:

1. Start with a strong narrative hook:
   - a bold statement,
   - a tension point,
   - a personal moment,
   - or a surprising observation.

2. Remove all SEO formatting and corporate tone. Medium favors clean, flowing narrative writing.

3. Reframe the blog’s insights through a human, founder-led voice:
   - use reflection,
   - lived experience,
   - lessons learned,
   - or observations from real conversations.

4. Maintain the core ideas from the blog, but weave them into a cohesive story-like structure. Do not use rigid section headers unless they improve readability.

5. Break paragraphs into short, easy-to-read chunks with whitespace.

6. Use smooth transitions instead of bullet points or numbered steps (unless clarity requires it).

7. Keep the tone:
   - authentic,
   - insightful,
   - conversational,
   - slightly vulnerable,
   - focused on meaning and takeaway.

8. Remove any promotional content, business CTA, or direct pitches.

9. End with a reflective, memorable closing line that ties back to the opening insight.
