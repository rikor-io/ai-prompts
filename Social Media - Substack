✅ UPDATED SUBSTACK PROMPT (With Ideal Length Rules Included)

PROMPT START

You are turning the following blog into a Substack-ready article written in a human, thoughtful, insight-driven founder voice.

Your goal is to convert the blog into a Substack-style post that:

Feels personal and story-driven

Positions the writer as a thought leader in franchisor risk, insurance, compliance, and brand protection

Gives readers a meaningful insight

Feels conversational, honest, and reflective

Delivers value without sounding promotional

Fits the writing culture and expectations of Substack

Write in clean, simple, conversational English.

SUBSTACK STYLE RULES
1. Target article length: 700–1,400 words

This is the ideal range for:

Thought leadership

Founder commentary

Risk insights

Story-driven franchise industry perspectives

If the blog is shorter, expand it thoughtfully with:

Founder observations

Narrative context

Real-world examples or patterns

If the blog is much longer, condense it — do NOT exceed 1,500 words unless absolutely necessary.

2. Start with a strong hook (1 short paragraph)

Open with something:

A little bold

A little surprising

Reflective or contrarian

Immediately engaging

This should feel like the start of a story or insight, not a corporate introduction.

3. Add a narrative element

Substack readers love context and lived experience.

Pull from:

Real franchisor situations (anonymized)

Patterns you've observed across 130+ brands

Conversations

Claims you've reviewed

Turning points in understanding

Make it human and real.

4. Deliver the core insight clearly

Explain:

What the issue really is

Why it matters now

What franchisors often misunderstand

What the consequences are

Why this topic keeps showing up across brands

This should feel like “behind-the-scenes intelligence.”

5. Add 3–5 short supporting sections

Each section should:

Expand on the idea

Use short paragraphs

Feel like you’re helping the reader think better

Emphasize simple, human clarity

Avoid corporate tone

Examples:

“What franchisors usually get wrong”

“Why this issue is increasing”

“What this means as a brand scales”

“The hidden downstream impact”

6. End with a reflective, memorable takeaway

Your conclusion should:

Feel thoughtful

Give the reader something to reflect on

Reinforce your expertise

Feel like a founder sharing a lesson learned

Do NOT include a hard pitch.

Optional soft close:

“If you’d like more insights like this, you can subscribe to the newsletter.”

TONE REQUIREMENTS

Write like:

A founder

A practitioner

Someone who has been inside 130+ franchise systems

Someone who has seen how risk shows up in the real world

Someone sharing hard-earned wisdom generously

Avoid:

Corporate marketing tone

Technical language

Sales pitches

Academic explanations

Use:

Short paragraphs

Clear language

Warmth + authority

FINAL OUTPUT FORMAT

Return the final article with:

A compelling Substack-style title

(Optional) A short subtitle

The full article following all rules above
