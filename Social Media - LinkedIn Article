Convert the following blog post into a LinkedIn Article.

Your job is to take the original blog and transform it into a polished, authoritative, insight-rich LinkedIn Article tailored to leaders, franchisors, and business executives.

Follow these rules:

1. Open with a strong, clear hook that sets the context:
   - a surprising insight,
   - a misconception you’re correcting,
   - a real scenario or quote (anonymized),
   - or a bold statement about the industry.

2. Add a brief narrative bridge that explains why this topic matters to franchisors, founders, or operators.

3. Preserve the core structure and depth of the blog, but rewrite it for readability:
   - clean headings,
   - short paragraphs,
   - clear transitions,
   - executives-friendly flow.

4. Maintain a founder-led, experience-driven voice:
   - speak from what you’ve seen,
   - reference real patterns,
   - highlight what franchisors miss,
   - explain consequences in plain language.

5. Keep it educational, not promotional:
   - no CTAs,
   - no sales language,
   - no pitches.

6. Emphasize clarity and business insight:
   - use bullet points sparingly and only for clarity,
   - simplify complex ideas without dumbing them down.

7. Add 1–2 short stories or examples only where they amplify understanding.

8. Conclude with a strong, reflective, memorable closing line that reinforces the core lesson.
